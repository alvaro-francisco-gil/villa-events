# AGENTS.md

North star for anyone (human or AI) modifying this repo. Short, opinionated, load-bearing. When this file disagrees with code, the file wins — fix the code.

## What this project is

Cultuvilla is a mobile-first web app for Spanish village communities. Organizations (ayuntamientos, peñas, asociaciones) publish events; residents and visitors discover them, sign up themselves and family members ("personas"), and village admins manage invites and org approvals.

The product surface and data model are specified in [docs/superpowers/specs/](docs/superpowers/specs/). Specs are the source of truth for *what* to build; this file is the source of truth for *how* to build it.

## Repo health beats every rule below

If a rule here makes the repo worse for a specific change, break the rule and update this file in the same PR. Rules exist to keep the codebase coherent, not to be obeyed mechanically.

## Architecture invariants

### 1. Service-layer ownership

Components, pages, and hooks **must not** import from `firebase/firestore`, `firebase/storage`, `firebase/functions`, or `firebase/auth` directly. All Firebase access goes through a service in [packages/shared/src/services/](packages/shared/src/services/). See [_services-map.md](packages/shared/src/services/_services-map.md) for the catalogue.

- Need `GeoPoint`, `Timestamp`, or the `User` type? Import from `@cultuvilla/shared/firebase` (the shared package re-exports them).
- The **only** exempt file is [apps/web/contexts/AuthContext.tsx](apps/web/contexts/AuthContext.tsx) — it owns the auth boundary (sign-in/out, listeners). Everything else routes through services.

This is enforced by `no-restricted-imports` in [apps/web/eslint.config.mjs](apps/web/eslint.config.mjs). If you find yourself wanting to disable it, add a service instead.

**Why:** Firebase SDK calls scattered through UI code are the #1 source of duplicate reads, missing security checks, and broken offline behaviour. One place per collection. One place to add caching or migrate when needed.

### 2. Shared types, shared models

Anything that crosses workspace boundaries — between web, functions, and any future mobile app — lives in [packages/shared](packages/shared). Domain types live under `src/models/`, organized by entity (event, village, person, etc.). Services consume models, never the reverse.

### 3. Data is nested under `villages/{villageId}/`

Single Firebase project. All village-scoped data is nested under that village's document; cross-village queries use Firestore **collection group** indexes (declared in [firestore.indexes.json](firestore.indexes.json)). When you add a new sub-collection, add the collection-group index in the same change.

### 4. Denormalized read models for high fan-out

When a query would require N reads or live across collection boundaries, write a denormalized read model and keep it in sync via a Cloud Function trigger. See [docs/architecture/denormalized-read-models.md](docs/architecture/denormalized-read-models.md) for the pattern; [functions/src/syncVillageDenormalization.ts](functions/src/syncVillageDenormalization.ts) is the canonical example.

### 5. Strict TypeScript

`strict: true` everywhere. No `any`. No `@ts-nocheck`. If a type is genuinely unknown at the boundary, use `unknown` and narrow. `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is an error in `apps/web`; the same standard applies in `packages/shared` and `functions` even though those aren't lint-gated yet — fix at the source, never silence with `as any`.

## Conventions

### Forms

Currently controlled inputs with `useState`. No form library yet. New forms should match the existing style until/unless we adopt `react-hook-form + zod` (see CHANGELOG — this is on the table).

### State and data fetching

React Context for cross-tree state (auth, village). No global store. No query cache today — every component fetches its own data via services. If you add a feature where this hurts (revalidation, optimistic updates, dedup), surface it in the PR rather than rolling your own cache.

### Styling

Tailwind 4. Utility classes inline. No CSS modules, no styled-components. `lucide-react` for icons.

### i18n

`next-intl` v4. Default locale is `es`. Messages in [apps/web/i18n/messages/](apps/web/i18n/messages/). User-facing strings go through `useTranslations()`; hardcoded Spanish is allowed only in dev-only surfaces (admin panels, debug pages) where i18n is not a current priority.

### Cloud Functions logging

Cloud Functions write to Cloud Logging. **Never use `console.*`** — `console.log("foo " + bar)` produces an unstructured `textPayload` that filters and dashboards can't query. Use the v2 logger instead, with a structured second arg:

```ts
import { logger } from 'firebase-functions/v2';

logger.info('Migrated persons', {
  handler: 'onOccupationProposalApproved',
  proposalId,
  pendingOccupation: name,
  migratedCount: snap.size,
});
```

The second arg becomes searchable `jsonPayload` fields in Cloud Logging. Always include a `handler` field so you can filter by Cloud Function name. Use `logger.warn` for recoverable anomalies and `logger.error` only when the function bails out unsuccessfully.

This rule is enforced by [functions/src/__tests__/helpers/no-console.test.ts](functions/src/__tests__/helpers/no-console.test.ts) — any `console.*` call under `functions/src/` (outside `__tests__/`) fails the build.

### File naming

- React components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `useCamelCase.ts`
- Services and models: `camelCaseService.ts`, `entityName.ts`
- Test files: colocated as `*.test.ts`

### Commit messages

Conventional commits, enforced by commitlint:

```
feat(scope): short imperative summary
fix(scope): ...
refactor(scope): ...
docs(scope): ...
chore(scope): ...
ci(scope): ...
```

Header ≤ 100 chars. Direct-to-main is fine (see `feedback_push_main` in user memory) — keep commits small and self-contained.

### Delete > deprecate

If something is unused, delete it. Don't leave dead code, "removed: …" comments, or shim re-exports. Git keeps history; the codebase should reflect the present.

### Comments

Don't explain *what* the code does — name things well instead. Only comment to explain *why* something non-obvious is the way it is: a security constraint, a Firestore quirk, a workaround for a specific bug.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # workspace deps (functions has its own — npm ci in functions/)
pnpm web:dev          # Next.js dev server
pnpm check            # lint + typecheck + test + build (CI gate)
pnpm lint             # eslint --max-warnings 0 in apps/web
pnpm typecheck        # tsc --noEmit in shared, web, functions
pnpm test             # vitest in packages/shared
```

Pre-commit (Husky + lint-staged) runs `eslint --max-warnings 0 --fix` on changed `apps/web` TypeScript files; commit-msg runs commitlint.

## Development workflow

All non-trivial changes follow the same loop. Tiny edits (typo in a doc, a renamed string) can skip steps 1 and 4, but any code change goes through every step.

1. **Work in a git worktree, not on main.** Branch from the latest `main` into a worktree under `.claude/worktrees/<short-name>/`. Never edit files in the main checkout. Worktrees isolate dependencies, build outputs, and `.next/` caches so parallel changes don't fight each other, and they make it easy to abandon work that doesn't pan out.
2. **Read the design spec** in [docs/superpowers/specs/](docs/superpowers/specs/) if one exists for the feature area.
3. **Look at the relevant service** in [packages/shared/src/services/](packages/shared/src/services/) before writing UI code; extend the service if the API you need is missing.
4. **Add or extend tests whenever possible.** Tests are the contract that survives refactors and AI rewrites. Specifically:
   - Pure logic, model builders, validation, and service helpers go in `packages/shared/test/` (vitest).
   - New ESLint rules, type-level contracts, or other "this must keep working" invariants get a test that fails if the invariant breaks (see [packages/shared/test/eslint/rules.test.ts](packages/shared/test/eslint/rules.test.ts) for the pattern).
   - If a change is genuinely untestable today (UI-only, no extractable logic), say so in the PR description and explain why.
5. **Keep documentation in sync.** If you add a new collection or denormalized field, update [packages/shared/src/services/_services-map.md](packages/shared/src/services/_services-map.md) and [docs/architecture/denormalized-read-models.md](docs/architecture/denormalized-read-models.md) in the same change. Note user-facing changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under `## [Unreleased]`.
6. **Run `pnpm check` before pushing.** CI runs the same gate; failing locally is faster than failing in Actions.
7. **Open a pull request** with `gh pr create`, even though direct-to-main is technically allowed. A PR is a written record of what changed and why, and lets CI gate the change before it touches `main`. The PR description should cover:
   - **What** changed at a level the future reader needs (not a diff restatement).
   - **Why** it was done — the motivating problem or design decision.
   - **Tests** that were added (or an explicit note if none were possible).
   - **Test plan** as a checklist: local check, CI, manual verification steps.
8. **Wait for the user to confirm the merge.** Once the PR is open and CI is green, summarize the result and stop. Do **not** merge autonomously, even if every check passes — the human is the merge gate.
9. **Before merging, rebase the branch onto the latest `main`.** `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`, resolve any conflicts, re-run `pnpm check`, then `git push --force-with-lease`. CI must go green again on the rebased commits before the merge. Stale branches cause silent breakage when the merge crosses a refactor that landed on main while the PR was in review.
10. **Merge with a merge commit, not squash or rebase.** Use `gh pr merge <n> --merge`. Squashing would collapse the carefully-scoped commits in the PR (e.g. "feature" + "test for feature") into one, which makes `git bisect` and `git blame` worse. Rebase-merging hides the PR boundary entirely. A merge commit preserves both.
11. **If you broke a rule in this file deliberately**, update this file in the same PR.

## Things to flag in PRs (or right here when you find them)

- Logic that bypasses a service.
- New `as any` / `@ts-nocheck` / `// eslint-disable`.
- New `<img>` usage when image optimization could matter.
- Reads in components that should be cached or batched.
- Spanish strings that escaped the i18n message catalog.
- Code changes that ship without tests when tests were possible.
- Work that landed outside a worktree (and so might have polluted main's checkout state).
